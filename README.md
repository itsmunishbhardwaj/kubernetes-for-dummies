## FAQ's

### Q. What is busy box?
Great question!

ðŸ§° What is busybox?

busybox is a tiny Linux utility that bundles many common UNIX/Linux command-line tools into a single lightweight executable. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for containers.

ðŸ§  Why use it?
	â€¢	âœ… It includes commands like: sh, cp, mkdir, ls, cat, etc.
	â€¢	âœ… Itâ€™s super small (a few MB) â€” perfect for init containers.
	â€¢	âœ… It doesnâ€™t need a full Linux OS image like ubuntu or alpine.

ðŸ“¦ In Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, busybox is often used in:
	â€¢	initContainers to do pre-setup tasks (like copying files)
	â€¢	debug containers where a full OS isnâ€™t needed
	â€¢	probes and simple exec jobs

ðŸ§ª Example

If you run:

kate run debug --image=busybox -it --restart=Never -- sh

Youâ€™ll drop into a minimal shell where you can run commands like:

mkdir /mydir
echo hello > /mydir/test.txt
cat /mydir/test.txt

All with just a few MB of image pull time.

So in your case, busybox is perfect for copying your Hadoop XML files into the right directory â€” no bloat, no extra dependencies.
